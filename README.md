# grammy
- a sloppy multiprocessed anagram finder originally made to solve NYT's [Strands](https://www.nytimes.com/games/strands) game
- it's inefficient and a lot of it was written by AI, don't judge me I was just stuck on a strands game one morning and made this to help me
- it's best when used to only find 2-4 words
- could probably integrate some sort of graph traversial to make it more efficient at solving Strands specifically but I probably won't do that
